A high accuracy "Moving Wheel" and Weathering Expression 2 for Locomotive bogies. I have been experimenting with a Weathering E2 I had made, and was planning to make a high accuracy "Moving Wheel / Axle" E2, and I decided to combine the two. The E2 gets an MPH input or MPH value from the velocity at which what direction the bogie is moving in, it converters this data with the Axle Circumference to convert the MPH input (A form of distance over time) to RPM (A unit of rotational speed or the frequency of rotation around a fixed Axis), it then converts this data into angular data which turns the hologram of the Wheel / Axle. - All pretty "Basic" Stuff.


# Installation

1. Click the "Clone or Download" button on the righthand side of the screen and select "Download Zip."
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate __INTO__ the "brightstar-master" Folder. You should see two items: a file named "titus's_ultra_realistic_roller_&_weathering-e2.txt", and readme.md.
4. Extract the two folders directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`.
The file path should then look like `expression2\titus's_ultra_realistic_roller_&_weathering-e2.txt`.
5. If you see the folder "Ultra-Realistic-Roller-Weathering-E2-master" inside the "expression2" folder, __YOU INSTALLED IT WRONG__ and the E2 will not work!

You will also need Metaladon's Models for it to work correctly.

If you're currently in-game in Garry's Mod, open the E2 Editor, and click the "Update" button under the list of E2s on the left hand side of the window.


# Wiring

To Wire:
1. Begin by spawning the E2 on the Bogie, or Locomotive.
2. Wire `E1` and `E2` to each Bogie. (This E2 does two bogies at once to limit the need of two e2s)
3. Wire `Slipping` to the RLCs "Wheelslip" Output

**NOTE:** This E2 can be Parented!

#### You're Done!
